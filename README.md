# License Choice

I chose the GNU General Public License because it allows others to use and modify my code but does not allow them to modify that code and then enact a more restrictive license. If I hadn't provided a license I would be protected under general copyright and nobody would be allowed to use or modify my code at all. This would likely result in people being unwilling to fork or work with my code in any sense as they would not be protected by any license.

# Relevant .gitignore: 

.env
